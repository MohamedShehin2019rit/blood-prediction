 # BLOOD DONAR PREDICTION 
                  
                  blood donar prediction is a machine learning model uses liner regression on predicting the blood donation
                 
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

                   Application By solving this problem the blood donation camps can get 40% more blood donorsSourcerer Code RequirementThe example code is in Python (version 3.6.6 
                   or higher will work).Dependencies import pandas import numpy import seaborn import matplotlib import Counter import sklearn Description Use Python to explore                      data related to blood donors and we want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time when the blood donation will be organised.
                   This process will be done  The code should run w/o errors. Appropriate use of data structures/types loops/conditional statements Packages functions coding                          practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability) Analysis Pose questions about the data Inspect the structure of the original data                      (very important) Clean the data Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics Visualize the data (using plt and seaborn) Perform additional                         exploratory analysis Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields. Feature Engineering Using domain knowledge of the data to create features                         that make machine learning algorithms work. Machine Learning Use of Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, SVC classifiers. File Descriptions ./data/                        contains the various datasets. ./Blood Donation Prediction.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the work I have done. References & Citations

# AZURE USED:
     
                Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model. In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks. The final output will be visualized in the     evaluated model.
